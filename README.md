# apple-collector
My first homebrew game.

# how to play
Its so simple.<br>
keep touching display and move colander.<br>
you can catch red or green apple only.<br>
if you get poison apple, you lose 1-life.<br><br>

red apple is 10 point, green apple is 20 point. you obtain each score when you catch apples.<br>
ofcourse, poison apple's point is zero.<br><br>

if you lose 6-life or last apple fall, this game is over.<br>
